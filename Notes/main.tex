\subsection{Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block:} group of sectors, every file must occupy at least 1 block. 0b file occupy whole block.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{512b =} good for lot of small files. More blocks = more metadata.
        \item \textbf{4096b =}  good for larger files, less metadata. Waste if there are small files.
